### Day 1
Today I almost finished the proposal and design document. My selected data was not competible with the idea I had so I had to find new data. Instead of number of trips as bubble and line chart variable I will use number of tourist arrivals at establishments. Also instead of 2 seperate figures for the year distribution of tourism and temperature I will now combine these in a dual axis to show the relationsship better.

### Day 2
Today I made the final dessicions for the proposal and design document:
+ Instead of a dropdown for the temperature variable in the linechart I will use a dropdown for the subject of the piechart, since this makes more sence regarding my sub question: do tourists of warm countries stay in their countries. 

Also I began making my homepage by chosing the bootstrap template and implementing my own pages (homepage, visualization, information) and some titles.
