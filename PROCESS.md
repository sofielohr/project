### Day 1
Today I almost finished the proposal and design document. My selected data was not competible with the idea I had so I had to find new data. Instead of number of trips as bubble and line chart variable I will use number of tourist arrivals at establishments. Also instead of 2 seperate figures for the year distribution of tourism and temperature I will now combine these in a dual axis to show the relationsship better.

### Day 2
Today I made the final dessicions for the proposal and design document:
+ Instead of a dropdown for the temperature variable in the linechart I will use a dropdown for the subject of the piechart, since this makes more sence regarding my sub question: do tourists of warm countries stay in their countries more.

Also I began making my homepage by chosing the bootstrap template and implementing my own pages (homepage, visualization, information) and some titles.

### Day 3 
I processed a part of the tourism data in python. I decided to not transform my data to a ready to use JSON in python but to alter it a bit in javascript aswel, so I can combine it with the temperature data. The structure I will be making will start with a year object, then as value the countries objects with the needed data inside.

### Day 4
During the standup I got the tip to search the internet a bit more for the average temperature values, since my data has a very complicated structure, and we suspected that somewhere on the internet there will be a dataset with the information I need which is easier to use. 

### Day 5
I tried to search voor datasets with average temperature in an easier way to process, but could not find any reliable one. I started processing the data by looping over all the files and calculating the average. I still have to combine the different weather stations by country using the stations.txt file. 

### Day 6
In de standup kreeg ik een tip om niet met loops de station data aan de countries te koppelen maar dit met merge functie van pandas te doen, die ik zelf nog nooit had gebruikt. Dit gaat veel sneller wat erg handig is voor de grote van de dataset die ik heb.

Ik ben halverwege de dag ziek geworden en ben heb 2 dagen ziek op bed gelegen. Ik zal dit in het weekend inhalen.
