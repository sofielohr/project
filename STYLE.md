### Comments

+ Comments are used when the code itself is not explaining enough.
+ All comments are in English. 
+ The comments are without capitals

### Indentation

+ 4 spaces are used as a tab. 
+ When adding methods (like .attr or .style) to an variable, this is done vertically.Example in the picture.

### Naming

+ Variable names are being chosen logical, just like function names. 
+ All names are lower case and only with - or _. 

### Gouping
+ After a function, 2 enters are being used. 

### Further
+ End simple statements with semicolon. 
+ Select values from a Object using ".key".
