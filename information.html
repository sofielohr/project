      <h1>Temperature and tourism</h1>
      <h6>Chosing your holiday destination includes a lot of variables, from whom the weather expectation is one. Can you see this coherence when visualizing the data?</h6>
      <p>For countries tourism expenditures are a very important income source. In 2016 the 500 mln. tourists in Europe accounted for 342 dollar total (tourism receipts) (European Union Tourism Trends). However, this important source of income (tourism) depends partly on the unmanageable variable climate. How much does climate, or more specific temperature, influence tourism in a country? Are there more tourists in a warm country? And how is the incoming and outgoing tourism distributed? Do citizens of warm countries stay in their own country more?</p>

      <h2>Bubble chart</h2>
      <p>In the bubblechart the relationship between tourism and temperature is shown by size and color of the bubbles. Countries like Italy, France and Spain have relatively big bubbles and relatively warm weather.</p>
      
      <h2>Line chart</h2>
      <p>If you're not only interested in the relationship in a whole year, you can see the development of tourism and temperature over the months in the chosen year in the line chart.</p>
      <p>The default is set to Netherlands and 2010.</p>

      <h2>Pie chart</h2>
      <p>In the piechart you can see weather residents of a country stay in their own country more (for example because it's a warm country) or go more to foreign countries on holidays.</p>
      <p>The default is set to Netherlands and 2010.</p>
