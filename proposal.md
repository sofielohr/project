Paragraph summary of the application goals


## Problem statement

Chosing your holiday destination includes a lot of variables, from whom the weather expectation is one. As the climate around the world is changing and tourism and weather seem highly correlated, it is good to visualize the most important weather and tourism factors side by side to see if there is a connection. Determining the effect of climate change on tourism would be something for future work, but stating the fact that there is a relationship would be a good start. Since Europe has the most international tourists arrivals from all the continents in the world (European Union Tourism Trends), this is the area I will be focussing on. 

## Solution



Map of Europe with temperature intensities. 
Scatterplot of temperature variable with tourism (international tourist arrivals), dropbown menu to change to something???

If you press country on the map you will see specific data about the weather and tourism:
Weather:
+ percentage of sun hours
+ rain
+ average temperature by month to see the distribution around the year
Tourism:
+ tourism spendings % of total import
+ number of trips by purpose
+ nights spend at accomodations over the year (country specific)

You can switch between these 2 pages of weather and tourism with a menu or butten or drop down
